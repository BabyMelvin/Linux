总体翻译：富乐发明了一种专注于灯光和所穿裙子和布料灯光以及颜色变化的舞蹈，在这种舞蹈中，她主要通过手的运动来保持裙子和布料的移动，有时候手可以通过藏在衣服中的棍子来延长。

这句话的时态问题：

* 第一个动词是devised 也就是一般过去式，这个词奠定了整句话的时态基调是过去

如果是一般现在时devise 那么整句话就是
Fuller **devise** a type of dance that **focus** on the shifting play of lights and colors on the voluminous skirts or draperies she wear, which she **keep** in constant motion principally through movements of her arms, sometimes **extended** with wands **concealed** under her costumes.

最后连个动词是被动语态， 都省略**which are**不是过去式，是过去分词做定语，和时态无关。

type this sentence by myself.

Fuller devised a new type of dance which focus on the shifting of light colors on shirts and clothes she wore, which principally moments controlled by her arms, sometimes extended by wands concealed under her costumes.

# 第三句

Her dancing also attracted the attention of French poets and painters of the period, for it appealed to their liking for mystery, their belief in art for art’s sake, a nineteenth-century idea that art is valuable in itself rather than because it may have some moral or educational benefit, and their efforts to synthesize form and content.

【**Her dancing also attracted the attention**】( of French poets and painters of the period), for **it appealed to** their liking for mystery, their belief in art for art’s sake, [a nineteenth-century idea (that art is valuable in itself rather than because it may have some moral or educational benefit)], and their efforts to synthesize form and content.

  * a nineteenth-century idea (that art is valuable in itself rather than because it may have some moral or educational benefit)

翻译：
她的舞蹈也吸引了当时的法国诗人和画家的目光，因为他们被这种舞蹈的神秘感吸引，被他们本身对艺术的信仰所吸引（这是一种19世纪的观点：艺术的本身比它的道德或者是教育意义更有价值），还有他们对于综合形式和内容作出的努力所吸引。

【**The ice shelf cores**】, (with a total length of 215 meters (705 feet)), 【**were long enough to penetrate through glacial ice**】—[which is formed from the compaction of snow and contains air bubbles]—and 【**to continue into the clear, bubble-free ice**】 (formed from seawater) [that freezes onto the bottom of the glacial ice].

然后再复杂一点

The ice shelf cores, **with a total length of 215 meters**, were long enough to penetrate through glacial ice and to continue into the clear bubble-free ice.

然后再复杂一点

The ice shelf cores, with a total length of 215 meters, were long enough to penetrate through glacial ice--which is formed from the compaction of snow and contains air bubbles--and to continue into the clear, bubble-free ice formed from seawater that freezes onto the bottom of the glacial ice.

and 连接两个并列的动词不定式，第二个不定式往往省略to
此时也可以写成：**and continue into the clear bubble-free ice**.
